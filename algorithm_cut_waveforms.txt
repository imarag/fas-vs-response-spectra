ο αλγόριθμος που κόβουν τις καταγραφες στην ESMdb, δίνεται παρακάτω από την Claudia.

Dear Nikos,

waveforms available through EIDA or IRIS web services are trimmed during  the uploading on the ESM database.
In this case, the following empirical formula, which depends on origin time (t), magnitude (M), and hypocentral distance (HYPO), is applied:

min_cut = -32.54864+(0.0147805*M)+(0.1946899*HYPO)-30
max_cut = -22.89723+(21.616684*M)+(0.3763951*HYPO)+120

if int(DEPTH) <= 35:
    min_cut = min_cut - 30
    max_cut = max_cut + 60
t1 = t + min_cut
t2 = t + max_cut


After data upload, in the current processing scheme the traces are trimmed  20s before P wave arrival (from travel times) and 80s after S wave arrival (from travel times).

Ciao,
Claudia
